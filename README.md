# Meteor Blaze Animations ([demo](animation.meteor.com))

This project is to explore `_uihooks` for animations. Specifically, I'm interested in [page transitions](http://www.tympanus.net/Development/PageTransitions/) integrated with iron router and animated inserting and removing elements in a list or table from a collection cursor.

We will have 2 pages that can animate between. One page will have buttons to add and remove from a collection list. This project also uses `percolate:velocityjs` for now.

## To Do

- better API for transitioning with iroun router, etc.
- slide to profile and back to leaderboard easily.
- animate moveElement when the leaderboard score changes
